## Implementation Notes

### Security Considerations

- Ensure proper CSRF protection for registration endpoints
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate email addresses properly
- Consider adding CAPTCHA for registration to prevent automated attacks
- Store credentials securely following WebAuthn best practices

### User Experience

- Provide clear guidance on WebAuthn support and requirements
- Offer fallback options for unsupported browsers
- Ensure the registration process is accessible
- Provide clear error messages for common issues
- Consider progressive enhancement for browsers without WebAuthn support

### Technical Approach

- Use existing WebAuthn libraries and services where possible
- Ensure proper database schema for storing user information and credentials
- Follow proper JWT handling practices for authentication after registration
- Implement proper logging for debugging and security auditing
- Consider internationalization for error messages and instructions
