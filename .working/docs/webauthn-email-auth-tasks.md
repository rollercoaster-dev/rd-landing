# WebAuthn and Email Authentication Implementation Tasks

## Project Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a highly accessible, privacy-focused authentication system using WebAuthn and email verification. The goal is to create an authentication experience that prioritizes the needs of neurodivergent users while maintaining strong security and privacy protections.

## Research Findings on Accessibility in Authentication

### WebAuthn Accessibility Benefits

WebAuthn (Web Authentication) offers significant accessibility advantages for users with cognitive and learning disabilities:

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Eliminates the need to remember complex passwords, which is particularly beneficial for users with memory impairments, executive function challenges, and other cognitive disabilities.

2. **Simplified Authentication Flow**: Provides a more straightforward authentication process that reduces the number of steps required, helping users with executive function difficulties who struggle with multi-step processes.

3. **Consistent Experience**: Offers a consistent authentication experience across websites, reducing the learning curve for neurodivergent users who benefit from predictable patterns.

4. **Reduced Anxiety**: Eliminates the stress and anxiety associated with forgotten passwords, which can be particularly challenging for users with anxiety disorders or ADHD.

5. **Physical Authentication**: Leverages biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition) or security keys that don't rely on memory, benefiting users with memory impairments.

6. **Phishing Resistance**: Protects vulnerable users from phishing attacks that might otherwise exploit cognitive vulnerabilities.

7. **WCAG Compliance**: Automatically meets WCAG 3.3.7 requirements by providing authentication that doesn't rely on cognitive function tests.

### Email Verification Accessibility Considerations

Email verification presents several accessibility challenges for users with cognitive disabilities:

1. **Time Pressure**: Limited-time verification codes can create anxiety and pressure for users who process information more slowly.

2. **Multi-Step Process**: Switching between applications (email and website) can be disorienting for users with executive function difficulties.

3. **Code Transcription**: Manually copying verification codes requires short-term memory and attention to detail, which can be challenging for many users.

4. **Email Management**: Finding verification emails among other messages can be difficult for users with attention or executive function challenges.

5. **Clear Instructions**: Many verification emails lack clear, simple instructions that would benefit users with cognitive disabilities.

6. **Reduced Memory Load**: Minimize reliance on memory throughout all processes
7. **User Control**: Give users control over timing and progression
8. **Helpful Feedback**: Provide clear feedback at every step
9. **Progressive Enhancement**: Ensure basic functionality works without advanced features
10. **Regular Testing**: Test with diverse users throughout development

## Privacy Considerations

Our authentication system prioritizes user privacy through these measures:

1. **Minimal Data Collection**: Only collect information that's absolutely necessary
2. **Local Authentication**: Use WebAuthn to keep biometric data on the user's device
3. **No Third-Party Services**: Self-host email services to avoid sharing user data
4. **Transparent Policies**: Clearly communicate what data is collected and how it's used
5. **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest
6. **User Control**: Give users the ability to delete their authentication data
7. **No Tracking**: Avoid unnecessary tracking or analytics in authentication flows

## Future Considerations

1. **Package Creation**: Consider extracting this authentication system into a reusable package for other Rollercoaster.dev projects
2. **Multi-Factor Options**: Explore additional authentication factors for users who need higher security
3. **Internationalization**: Add support for multiple languages in authentication interfaces and emails
4. **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive security logging for authentication events
5. **Analytics**: Add anonymous usage analytics to identify accessibility pain points

By following these tasks and principles, we'll create an authentication system that is not only secure but also accessible to users with a wide range of cognitive abilities and needs, while respecting their privacy and providing a foundation for future enhancements.
