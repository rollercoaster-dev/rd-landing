# Page Composition Patterns

Opinionated patterns for composing pages with clarity and low cognitive load.

## Landing Page

1. Hero
   - Gradient headline (RdHeadlineGradient), neutral subtitle
   - Subtle background motif (one only), no parallax
2. 3-up Value Props
   - Cards with icons; concise copy; CTA to learn more
3. Community / Social Proof (optional)
   - Logos or brief quotes; keep contrast high
4. Roadmap Teaser
   - Short bullets + link to Roadmap
5. Primary CTA
   - Join waitlist / View on GitHub
6. Footer
   - Nav clusters, legal, social

## Secondary Page

1. Intro Block
   - Plain headline + short summary
2. Chunked Sections
   - RdContentChunker / Tabs; progressive disclosure
3. CTA
   - Contextual, not competing with primary site CTA

## Writing & Content Notes

- Short paragraphs (≤ 5 sentences); use lists
- Max text width 65–72ch
- Concrete headings; avoid cleverness
- Use examples and visuals over long prose where possible
